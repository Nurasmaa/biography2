<P>The person in that picture is my family. I have a biggest family. My father name is Sukri bin Abdullah and he work as fishermen. He is 53 years old and my mother is <br> 51 years old. My mother is a full time housewife. I have 5 sibling and i am the fourth child for my parents. My first sister and second brother is already married. I have <br> 6 nephew already in this year. I love my family so much. </P>

<h4 style="font-size: 15px;">My Feature</h3>

<p title="My Feature"> I will let you know about myself in this writing. I am :    </p>

<ul>
	<li>Friendly</li>
	<li>Trying hard</li>
	<li>Appreciate time</li>
</ul>

<p title="Friendly">First, i am a friendly person because if i go anywhere i can make new friend at that place immediately. For example, if i go to cooking class, at the first day i will talk <br> without any  shame with another person in that class. I will talk to them like i have know them for a long time. I really like to have many friends because with friends,<br>  my life will happy and i will get to know about another person attitude.  </p>

<p title="Trying hard">The second feature about myself is i am trying hard person. Why i am saying this because if i what something i must get it such as i want to have new handbag so i will <br> save my money to get the handbag. Another example is when i am missed in my study, i will learn again until i understand the matter. I am not satisfied until i get what <br> i need. I am grateful that i have this feature in myself because it make me excited everyday.  </p>

<p title="Appreciate Time"> Lastly, i am the person that really appreciate time. Time is like gold because if you miss that time, whatever you do you cannot bring that time again. I really dont like a <br> person that cannot appreciate time for example when that person promise with me to go out, and they cannot keep their promise to came at the time. When i promise with <br> someone to see out there, i will at the promise time. I also always go to class before the lecturer come because if i am late, i miss my study. </p>

<P>That all my writting for today, i will see you next time. If u have interest to know about me in detail, you can whatsapps me with the link below because i am really like to <br> making new friends. Thank you for your time to reading my article. </P>
